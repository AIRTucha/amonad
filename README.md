Implementation of *Maybe* and *Result* monads compatible with async/await. 

*Maybe* is a container dedicated for handling of a data which might be missing. Typically, it is used to represent an optional values. It allows to avoid usage of Nullable objects. *Result* is an expansion of *Maybe* which can additionally carry the reason of unavailability. It is mainly utilized to represent the output of an operation which might fail, since *Result* is also capable to carry an error message. 

Both of them implements a fraction of Promise's functionality. It allows to model both of them via Promise. Therefore by implementation of PromiseLike interface they became compatible with async/await syntax.
